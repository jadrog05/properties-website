## Features

* **Accommodation Search:** Users can search for accommodation options in different countries for a short stay using various filters such as location, dates, amenities, etc.
* **Booking System:** Users can make bookings for their desired accommodations directly through the website. The booking details, including the user's information, selected dates, and accommodation details, will be securely stored in a MySQL database.
* **User Authentication:** Implement a secure user authentication system to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their bookings. This ensures privacy and security for both users and their booking information. [WIP]
